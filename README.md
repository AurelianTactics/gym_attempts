## Attempts at solving various OpenAI gym environments

### Solved Environments:
* cartpoleV0: Q-Table implementation
* cartpoleV0: Neural network function approximation implementation (Deep Q)
* acrobotV1: Neural network function approximation implementation (Deep Q)


### Unsuccessful Attempts:
* acrobotV1: Table method. Too many states. Attempted Q-table and monte carlo methods.
